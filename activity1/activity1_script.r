#Activity 1
print("hello R world")

#PRACTICE: mathematical operations
#6 raised to the power of 6
6^6

#5 plus 210
5+210

#3 minus 10
3-10

#PRACTICE: naming and assigning values
#name a number, will show up in environment
a<- 2446

#multiply my number by 5
5*a

#divide my number by 2
a/2


#PRACTICE: vectors
#make a vector
b <- c(2446,40,1000)

#divide all numbers in the vector by 2
#this doesn't change the values in the vector
b/2

#QUESTION 3
#create a vector
myvector<- c(240, 23, 89, 74, 65)
#calculation 1: multiply my vector by 3
myvector*3
#calculation 2: divide my vector by 14
myvector/14
#calculation 3: add 23 to all values in my vector
myvector+23
